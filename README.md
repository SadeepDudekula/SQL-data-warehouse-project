### 1.Bronze : stores raw data from the source system Data is ingested from CSVfiles into SQL
servers.
### 2.Silver : this layer includes data cleaning,standardization and normalization processes to prepare data for
analysis.
### 3.Gold : Houses bussinesss ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
